- On Linux and Mac OS X, only 802.11 headers are received in promiscuos mode
- Certain operating systems and adapters do no collect management or control packets
- The wrong network card drivers were in use by Wireshark
- The wireless card was not turned on

Question 16:
When you are testing a web application, it is very useful to employ a proxy tool to save every request and response.
